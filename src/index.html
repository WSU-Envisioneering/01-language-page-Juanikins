  <h1>UI and UX </h1>
  <h2>Home Page</h2>
  <p>This website is about UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) design. UX focuses on how a user feels when they use a product, while UI is about how the product looks and how users interact with it. In this content, I will explain the basics of UX and UI, their importance in digital design, and how they work together to create websites and apps that are easy to use and visually appealing. </p>
